## Description

A C++ project that focuses on the calculation with matrices. Functions:

- Add two 2D matrices
- Multiply two 2D matrices
- Export a given 2D matrix into a static-int array

At first I tried to store the matrices in my own programmed dynamic lists (concatenated lists), but then decided to use std::vectors for efficiency and security reasons.
